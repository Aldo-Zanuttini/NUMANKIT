#### NOTE: the above can be done in parallel for hopf, branchpoint and fold. This could save you a lot of time potentially. To do this, run the "parallel_env_start.jl" file with the necessary adjustments (specify the absolute path to your "NUMANKIT" folder), please remember to reset the number of working processors to 1 when you're done doing the analysis!!! This can be done via the "rmprocs(workers())" command.

# normally here you should check that bifurcation_points contains hopf, fold and/or branchpoints. In this case we know the Lorenz system, so we know we'll find all three types of singularity

scatter!([fold_points[end,:]],[fold_points[2,:]],ms=4,label="LP")
branch_points=bifurcation_points.BP.BP # extract the branchpoints
scatter!([branch_points[end,:]],[branch_points[2,:]],ms=4,label="BP")
display(plot!(legend=true))


# Okay: we have a branchpoint. Let's compute the other branch too! (see "second_equilibrium_branch.jl" file)
